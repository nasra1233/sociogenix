ISO 27001: Ensure data security compliance.

Architecture
SocioGenix uses a serverless architecture on Firebase, with:
Frontend:
Web: React with Material-UI, React-DnD, Chart.js, and Firebase SDKs.

Mobile: Flutter with flutter_stripe, charts_flutter, and Firebase SDKs.

Backend: Node.js Cloud Functions with Firebase Admin SDK, Stripe, Google Cloud TTS, and mock social media APIs.

Database: Firestore for users, accounts, analytics, and trends.

Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage for TTS MP3s and potential video uploads.

Authentication: Firebase Authentication (email/password, extensible to Google OAuth).

Hosting: Firebase Hosting for the React app.

APIs: Mocked for Instagram, X.com, YouTube, Reddit, TikTok; placeholders for WhatsApp, Telegram, Snapchat, Pinterest, LinkedIn.

Data Flow:
User logs in via Firebase Authentication.

Web/mobile app calls Cloud Functions (/api/connect, /api/post, etc.).

Functions interact with Firestore, Stripe, or external APIs.

Analytics and trends are cached in Firestore and SharedPreferences (mobile).

TTS audio is generated and stored in Cloud Storage.

Security:
Firestore rules restrict access to authorized users.

Stripe webhooks ensure subscription updates.

Mock vulnerability scanning for compliance.

All code file paths use underscores (_) instead of slashes (/) to flatten the directory structure.

Maintenance and Scaling
Maintenance
Update Dependencies:
Frontend: Run npm update in frontend.

Backend: Run npm update in functions.

Mobile: Run flutter pub upgrade in mobile.

Monitor Firebase Usage:
Check Firestore read/write limits, Cloud Functions invocations, and Storage usage in Firebase Console.

Stripe Webhooks:
Monitor webhook events in Stripe Dashboard for failed payments.

Trend Scraping:
Ensure scrapeTrends function runs daily (every 24 hours schedule).

Security:
Run mock vulnerability scans via /api/scan.

Update Firestore/Storage rules for new features.

Scaling
Increase Firestore Capacity:
Upgrade Firebase plan for higher read/write throughput.

Optimize Cloud Functions:
Add caching (e.g., Redis) for analytics and trends.

Split functions into separate modules for better cold-start performance.

Expand Social Media APIs:
Integrate real APIs for WhatsApp, Telegram, Snapchat, Pinterest, LinkedIn.

Example for WhatsApp Business API:
javascript

exports.postWhatsApp = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  const { content, phone } = req.body;
  await axios.post('https://api.whatsapp.com/v1/messages', { to: phone, body: content });
  res.json({ status: 'Posted to WhatsApp' });
});

Enhance Analytics:
Deploy TensorFlow.js in Cloud Functions for real predictive models.

Video Uploads:
Add video storage in Cloud Storage:
javascript

exports.uploadVideo = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  const file = bucket.file(`videos/${Date.now()}.mp4`);
  await file.save(req.body);
  const [url] = await file.getSignedUrl({ action: 'read', expires: '2025-12-31' });
  res.json({ url });
});

Load Balancing:
Use Firebase Hosting CDN for static assets.

Deploy Functions to multiple regions (e.g., us-central1, europe-west1).

Troubleshooting
Frontend Fails to Load:
Check frontend_firebase.json for correct public directory (build).

Verify Firebase Hosting deployment: firebase deploy --only hosting.

Ensure YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID is correct in frontend_src_App.js.

Cloud Functions Errors:
View logs: firebase functions:log.

Check environment variables: firebase functions:config:get.

Ensure Stripe and Google Cloud credentials are set.

Mobile App Crashes:
Verify mobile_lib_main.dart is set as entry point in android/app/build.gradle.

Check Firebase configuration files (google-services.json, GoogleService-Info.plist).

Run flutter clean and flutter pub get.

Stripe Payment Fails:
Test with Stripe test cards (e.g., 4242424242424242).

Verify webhook URL and secret in Stripe Dashboard.

Check Cloud Functions logs for webhook errors.

TTS Audio Not Generated:
Ensure Google Cloud TTS API is enabled.

Verify GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is set.

Check Storage rules for tts/ path.

Social Media Posting Fails:
Replace mock APIs with real implementations (e.g., instagram-private-api).

Verify API keys and OAuth tokens.
